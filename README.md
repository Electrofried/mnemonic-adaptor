## **Key Features**

- **Configurable and Modular Design** 🛠️: Centralized configuration for API endpoints, model parameters, and operational settings ensures flexibility and scalability.
- **Dynamic Prompt Management** ✏️: Easily load and customize system and user prompts via external files, enabling tailored workflows for varied use cases.
- **Advanced Memory Segmentation** 🧠: Extract and organize critical information from text, generating structured JSON outputs suitable for downstream processing.
- **Chunked Input Processing** 🔄: Handles large text inputs by dividing them into manageable segments while preserving coherence for inputs up to **20,000 characters**.
- **Robust Error Handling** 🛡️: Implements comprehensive error management with detailed logging to address issues with file operations, API communication, and JSON parsing.
- **Efficient Output Management** 📁: Saves extracted memory objects as uniquely named JSON files, systematically organized within a designated output directory with detailed logging.
- **Type Safety** ✅: Comprehensive type hints throughout the codebase for better IDE support and code clarity.
- **Centralized Logging** 📝: Structured logging system with both file and console output for better debugging and monitoring.

## **Getting Started**

1. **Clone the repository** 🛠️:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/mnemonic-adaptor.git
   cd mnemonic-adaptor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** 📦:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure settings** ⚙️:
   Adjust the configuration in `config.py` to align with your specific requirements. The configuration uses a `Config` dataclass for type safety and validation. Ensure you have your DeepSeek API key in the `api.txt` file or set it as an environment variable.

4. **Run the script** ▶️:

   ```bash
   python main.py "Your text here"
   python main.py /path/to/text_file.txt
   ```

## **Customization**

Tailor system and user prompts to specific use cases by modifying the respective `.json` files. For example, you can adjust tone, level of detail, or domain specificity to align with tasks such as generating concise technical summaries or simplifying content for general audiences. These adjustments directly influence the tool's output, ensuring it remains adaptable and purpose-driven.

Editable prompt files include:

- `prompts.json` ✏️: Contains system and user prompts for memory extraction and segmentation.
